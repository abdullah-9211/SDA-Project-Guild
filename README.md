# SDA-Project-Guild
A JavaFX Application using Java for front end and business logic. For our database, we used MySQL for storing information of the teams, players, users, announcements etc.
The application has 4 types of users; Admin, Council Members, Players and Captains.
Captains covered most use cases like team attendance, scheduling practices and fixtures, equipment management etc. Within the captain dashboard all these options are available.
Players have basic functions like viewing schedules and attendance.
Council are mostly responsible for managing events and meetings amongst different parties.
Admin is responsible for user management.
Login functionality is there and errors are taken care of.
Once a user logs in, they are presented with the dashboard according to user type, where all their functionalities are present. The user can select them and perform those functionalities.
